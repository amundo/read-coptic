There was someone in Egypt who had a paralyzed son. And he brought him and set him in the cell of Apa Makarios, and he left him weeping near the door, and he went to a distance. The monk looked and saw the little boy weeping, and he said to him, "Who brought you here?" And he said, "It was my father. He brought me, he cast me away, and he went." The monk said to him, "Get up and run and catch up to him." And immediately, he became well, and he arose, he caught up to his father, and in this way they went to their house rejoicing.

Note: The term ⲁⲡⲁ is a title of respect, ultimately from Aramaic ʾabbā, father. ⲙⲁⲕⲁⲣⲓⲟⲥ is a proper name.
